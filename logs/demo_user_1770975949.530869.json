The fact that you're experiencing discomfort in the gums nearby could indicate some irritation or inflammation. It's a good idea to get this checked out, as a dental professional can assess the situation and determine the best course of action. \n\nSince your symptoms suggest you might need restorative dentistry to address the crown and any gum issues, would you like me to show you available doctors for an appointment?"
